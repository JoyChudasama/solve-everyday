// Topological Sort - BFS/Kahn's Algorithm 

// It works by repeatedly removing nodes with zero indegree (i.e., no incoming edges), ensuring that all dependencies are resolved before a node is processed.

// How It Works

// Build the graph (adjacency list).
// Calculate indegree (number of incoming edges) for each node.
// Initialize a queue with all nodes that have 0 indegree.
// While the queue is not empty:
// Remove a node from the queue.
// Add it to the topological order.
// Decrease the indegree of its neighbors by 1.
// If any neighborâ€™s indegree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
// If the result contains all nodes, return it. Otherwise, a cycle exists, and topological sorting is not possible.

// O(vertices + edges) time
// O(vertices + edges) space
